IV33.dat is the 3D Vp travel time tomography model from Persaud et al. (2016).
The columns of the file are: x (km) y (km) z (km) vp (km/s), where 
x, y, and z are utm coordinates in km and the columns increase in x.y.z order. 
Grid spacing is 1 km in each spatial dimension. 

1. Number of grid points in x, y, and z. 

nx = 66
ny = 86
nz = 9

nx = 1 is left, nx = 66 is right.
ny = 1 is bottom, ny = 86 is top.
nz = 1 is top, nz = 9 is bottom.

2. Depth, in meters.

Minimum depth = 0 km
Maximum depth = 8 km
depth_interval = 1 km

NOTE: 0 km is ~ sea level and 8 km depth is 8 km below sea level. 

3. Corners in UTM projection.

bottom_left_corner_e = 589 km
bottom_left_corner_n = 3607 km
bottom_right_corner_e = 654 km
bottom_right_corner_n = 3607 km
top_left_corner_e = 589 km
top_left_corner_n = 3692 km 
top_right_corner_e = 654 km
top_right_corner_n = 3692 km

4. Corners in geographic coordinates.

utm zone = 11 S
bottom_left_corner_lon = -116.051578
bottom_left_corner_lat = 32.596922
bottom_right_corner_lon = -115.344866
bottom_right_corner_lat = 32.596922
top_left_corner_lon = -116.051578
top_left_corner_lat = 33.356203
top_right_corner_lon = -115.344866
top_right_corner_lat = 33.356203

5. Additional notes:

(i) Grid cells with no ray coverage (i.e., zero) have the field value of NaN.
